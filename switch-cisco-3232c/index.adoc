You can use Cisco 3232C switches as cluster switches in your AFF or FAS cluster. You can use these procedures to install the switch, migrate from an existing switch, replace a switch, and update the RCF files on the switch.


You can install the Cisco Nexus 3232C switch (X190100) NetApp system cabinet with the
custom brackets that come with the switch, or you can install it in a rack with the standard
brackets that are also included with the switch.
