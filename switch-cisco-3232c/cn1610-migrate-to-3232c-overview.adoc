[.lead]
Cisco Nexus 3232C switches can be used as cluster switches in your AFF or FAS cluster. Cluster switches allow you to build ONTAP clusters with more than two nodes. 

.Before you begin

Before migration, be sure to review link:migrate-requirements-3232c.html[Migration requirements]. 

NOTE: The procedure requires the use of both ONTAP commands and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches commands; ONTAP commands are used unless otherwise indicated.

If necessary, refer to the following for more information:

* http://support.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/cm_switches_ntap/[NetApp CN1601 and CN1610 description page^]
* http://support.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/cm_switches/[Cisco Ethernet Switch description page^]

.About the examples

The examples in the migration procedure use four nodes: 

* Two nodes use four 10 GbE cluster interconnect ports: *e0a*, *e0b*, *e0c*, and *e0d*. 
* The other two nodes use two 40 GbE cluster interconnect fiber cables: *e4a* and *e4e*.

The link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[_Hardware Universe_^] has information about the cluster fiber cables for your platforms.

The examples in this procedure use the following switch and node nomenclature:

* The nodes are *n1*, *n2*, *n3*, and *n4*.
* The command outputs might vary depending on different releases of ONTAP software.
* The CN1610 switches to be replaced are *CL1* and *CL2*.
* The Nexus 3232C switches to replace the CN1610 switches are *C1* and *C2*.
* *n1_clus1* is the first cluster logical interface (LIF) that is connected to cluster switch 1 (CL1 or C1) for node *n1*.
* *n1_clus2* is the first cluster LIF that is connected to cluster switch 2 (CL2 or C2) for node *n1*.
* *n1_clus3* is the second LIF that is connected to cluster switch 2 (CL2 or C2) for node *n1*.
* *n1_clus4* is the second LIF that is connected to cluster switch 1 (CL1 or C1) for node *n1*.
* The number of 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE ports are defined in the reference configuration files (RCFs) available on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/sanswitch/fcp/Cisco/netapp_cnmn/download.shtml[CiscoÂ® Cluster Network Switch Reference Configuration File Download^] page.
