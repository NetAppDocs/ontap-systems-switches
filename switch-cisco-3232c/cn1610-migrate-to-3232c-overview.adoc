[.lead]
Cisco Nexus 3232C switches can be used as cluster switches in your AFF or FAS cluster. Cluster switches allow you to build ONTAP clusters with more than two nodes. 

NOTE: The procedure requires the use of both ONTAP commands and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches commands; ONTAP commands are used unless otherwise indicated.

If necessary, refer to the following for more information:

== CN1610 migrate requirements
The cluster switches support the following node connections:

* NetApp CN1610: ports 0/1 through 0/12 (10 GbE)
* Cisco Nexus 3232C: ports e1/1-30 (40 or 100 or 4x10GbE)

The cluster switches use the following inter-switch link (ISL) ports.

* NetApp CN1610: ports 0/13 through 0/16 (10 GbE)
* Cisco Nexus 3232C: ports 1/31-32 (100GbE)

[NOTE]
====
You must use 4x10G breakout cables on the Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster switch.

The following table shows the cabling connections that are required at each stage as you make the transition from NetApp CN1610 switches to Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster switches:
[options="header"]
|===
| Stage| Description| Required cables
a|
Initial
a|
CN1610 to CN1610 (SFP+ to SFP+)
a|
4 SFP+ optical fiber or copper direct-attach cables
a|
Transition
a|
CN1610 to 3232C (QSFP to SFP+)
a|
1 QSFP and 4 SFP+ optical fiber or copper breakout cables

3232C to 3232C (QSFP to QSFP)

You must have downloaded the applicable reference configuration files (RCFs). The number of 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE ports are defined in the RCFs available on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/sanswitch/fcp/Cisco/netapp_cnmn/download.shtml[Cisco® Cluster Network Switch Reference Configuration File Download^] page.

The ONTAP and NX-OS versions that are supported in this procedure are listed on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/cm_switches/.html[Cisco Ethernet Switches page^].

The ONTAP and FASTPATH versions that are supported in this procedure are listed on the link:http://support.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/cm_switches_ntap/.html[NetApp CN1601 and CN1610 Switches page^].

.About the examples used

The examples in the migration procedure use four nodes: 

* Two nodes use four 10 GbE cluster interconnect ports: *e0a*, *e0b*, *e0c*, and *e0d*. 
* The other two nodes use two 40 GbE cluster interconnect fiber cables: *e4a* and *e4e*. 
+
The link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[_Hardware Universe_^] has information about the cluster fiber cables for your platforms.

The examples in this procedure use the following switch and node nomenclature:

* The nodes are *n1*, *n2*, *n3*, and *n4*.
* The command outputs might vary depending on different releases of ONTAP software.
* The CN1610 switches to be replaced are *CL1* and *CL2*.
* The Nexus 3232C switches to replace the CN1610 switches are *C1* and *C2*.
* *n1_clus1* is the first cluster logical interface (LIF) that is connected to cluster switch 1 (CL1 or C1) for node *n1*.
* *n1_clus2* is the first cluster LIF that is connected to cluster switch 2 (CL2 or C2) for node *n1*.
* *n1_clus3* is the second LIF that is connected to cluster switch 2 (CL2 or C2) for node *n1*.
* *n1_clus4* is the second LIF that is connected to cluster switch 1 (CL1 or C1) for node *n1*.
* The number of 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE ports are defined in the reference configuration files (RCFs) available on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/sanswitch/fcp/Cisco/netapp_cnmn/download.shtml[Cisco® Cluster Network Switch Reference Configuration File Download^] page.
