[.lead]
You must be aware of certain configuration information, port connections, and cabling requirements when you replace CN1610 cluster switches with Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster switches.

The cluster switches support the following node connections:

* NetApp CN1610: ports 0/1 through 0/12 (10 GbE)
* Cisco Nexus 3232C: ports e1/1-30 (40 or 100 or 4x10GbE)

The cluster switches use the following inter-switch link (ISL) ports.

* NetApp CN1610: ports 0/13 through 0/16 (10 GbE)
* Cisco Nexus 3232C: ports 1/31-32 (100GbE)

[NOTE]
====
You must use 4x10G breakout cables on the Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster switch.

The following table shows the cabling connections that are required at each stage as you make the transition from NetApp CN1610 switches to Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster switches:

You must have downloaded the applicable reference configuration files (RCFs). The number of 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE ports are defined in the RCFs available on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/sanswitch/fcp/Cisco/netapp_cnmn/download.shtml[CiscoÂ® Cluster Network Switch Reference Configuration File Download^] page.

The ONTAP and NX-OS versions that are supported in this procedure are listed on the Cisco Ethernet Switches page.
