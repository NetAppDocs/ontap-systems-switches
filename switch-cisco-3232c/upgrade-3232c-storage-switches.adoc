[.lead]
Follow these steps to upgrade the Cisco NX-OS software and reference configuration files (RCF) on Cisco Nexus 3232C switches.

== Review requirements

.What you'll need

Ensure that the following conditions exist before you upgrade the NX-OS software and RCFs on the storage switch:

* The switch is fully functioning (there should be no errors in the logs or similar issues).
* You have checked or set your desired boot variables in the RCF to reflect the desired boot images if you are installing only NX-OS and keeping your current RCF version.
+
If you need to change the boot variables to reflect the current boot images, you must do so before reapplying the RCF so that the correct version is instantiated on future reboots.

* You have referred to the appropriate software and upgrade guides available on the http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9670/prod_installation_guides_list.html[Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches^] page for complete documentation on the Cisco storage upgrade and downgrade procedures.

* The number of 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE ports are defined in the reference configuration files (RCFs) available on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cisco-ethernet-switch[CiscoÂ® Ethernet Switches^] page.

== Replace the switch

.About the examples
The examples in this procedure use the following switch and node nomenclature:

* The names of the two storage switches are S1 and S2.
* The nodes are node1 and node2.

The examples in this procedure use two nodes; node1 with two storage ports and node2 with two storage ports. See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com/SWITCH/INDEX[Hardware Universe^] to verify the correct storage ports on your platforms.

NOTE: The procedure requires the use of both ONTAP commands and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches commands; ONTAP commands are used unless otherwise indicated. The command outputs might vary depending on different releases of ONTAP.

=== Step 1: Check the health status of switches and ports 

. If AutoSupport is enabled, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message:
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all - message MAINT=xh`
+
_x_ is the duration of the maintenance window in hours.
+
NOTE: The AutoSupport message notifies technical support of this maintenance task so that automatic case creation is suppressed during the maintenance window.

. Check that the storage switches are available:
+
`system switch ethernet show`
+

=== Step 2: Copy the RCF to Cisco switch S2 

. Copy the RCF on switch S2 to the switch bootflash using one of the following transfer protocols: FTP, HTTP, TFTP, SFTP, or SCP.

S2# *copy Nexus_3232C_RCF_v1.6-Storage.txt running-config echo-commands*
----
====

. Verify that the RCF file is the correct newer version:
+
`show running-config`
+
When you check the output to verify you have the correct RCF, make sure that the following information is correct:
+
 * The RCF banner
 * The node and port settings
 * Customizations
+
The output varies according to your site configuration. Check the port settings and refer to the release notes for any changes specific to the RCF that you have installed.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the banner output from the `show banner motd` command, you must read and follow the instructions in the *IMPORTANT NOTES* section to make sure the proper configuration and operation of the switch.

* Port Usage : Storage configuration
* Ports  1-32: Controller and Shelf Storage Ports
* Ports 33-34: Disabled

* IMPORTANT NOTES*
* - This RCF utilizes QoS and requires TCAM re-configuration, requiring RCF
*   to be loaded twice with the Storage Switch rebooted in between.
*
* - Perform the following 4 steps to ensure proper RCF installation:
*
*   (1) Apply RCF first time, expect following messages:
*       - Please save config and reload the system...
*       - Edge port type (portfast) should only be enabled on ports...
*       - TCAM region is not configured for feature QoS class IPv4 ingress...
*
*   (2) Save running-configuration and reboot Cluster Switch
*
*   (3) After reboot, apply same RCF second time and expect following messages:
*       - % Invalid command at '^' marker
*       - Syntax error while parsing...
*
*   (4) Save running-configuration again
******************************************************************************

NOTE: When applying the RCF for the first time, the *ERROR: Failed to write VSH commands* message is expected and can be ignored.
+
. After you verify that the software versions and switch settings are correct, copy the `running-config` file to the `startup-config` file on switch S2.
+
