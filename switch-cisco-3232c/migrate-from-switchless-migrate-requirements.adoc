[.lead]
If you have a two-node switchless cluster, you can migrate to a two-node switched cluster that includes Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster network switches. This is a nondisruptive procedure. 

.Before you begin

Verify the following installations and connections:

* Ports are available for node connections. The cluster switches use the Inter-Switch Link (ISL) ports e1/31-32.
* You have appropriate cables for cluster connections:
 ** The nodes with 10 GbE cluster connections require QSFP optical modules with breakout fiber cables or QSFP to SFP+ copper breakout cables.
 ** The nodes with 40/100 GbE cluster connections require supported QSFP/QSFP28 optical modules with fiber cables or QSFP/QSFP28 copper direct-attach cables.
 ** The cluster switches require the appropriate ISL cabling: 
*** 2x QSFP28 fiber or copper direct-attach cables.

* The configurations are properly set up and functioning.
+
The two nodes must be connected and functioning in a two-node switchless cluster setting.

* All cluster ports are in the *up* state.
* The Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster switch are supported.
* The existing cluster network configuration has the following:
 ** A redundant and fully functional Nexus 3232C cluster infrastructure on both switches
 ** The latest RCF and NX-OS versions on your switches
 ** Management connectivity on both switches
 ** Console access to both switches
 ** All cluster logical interfaces (LIFs) in the *up* state without having been migrated
 ** Initial customization of the switch
 ** All ISL ports enabled and cabled

.About the examples used

The examples in this procedure use the following switch and node nomenclature:

* Nexus 3232C cluster switches, *C1* and *C2*.
* The nodes are *n1* and *n2*.

The examples in this procedure use two nodes, each using two 40 GbE cluster interconnect ports *e4a* and *e4e*. The link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[_Hardware Universe_^] has details about the cluster ports on your platforms.

* *n1_clus1* is the first cluster logical interface (LIF) to be connected to cluster switch *C1* for node *n1*.
* *n1_clus2* is the first cluster LIF to be connected to cluster switch *C2* for node *n1*.
* *n2_clus1* is the first cluster LIF to be connected to cluster switch *C1* for node *n2*.
* *n2_clus2* is the second cluster LIF to be connected to cluster switch *C2* for node *n2*.
* The number of 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE ports are defined in the reference configuration files (RCFs) available on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/sanswitch/fcp/Cisco/netapp_cnmn/download.shtml[CiscoÂ® Cluster Network Switch Reference Configuration File Download^] page.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure requires the use of both ONTAP commands and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches commands; ONTAP commands are used unless otherwise indicated.
