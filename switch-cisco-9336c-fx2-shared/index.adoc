[.lead]
From ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches to combine storage and cluster functionality into a shared switch configuration.

If you want to build ONTAP clusters with more than two nodes, you need two supported network switches.

== Overview of Nexus 9336C-FX2
You can install the Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 switch (X190200/X190210) in a NetApp system cabinet or third-party cabinet with the standard brackets that are included with the switch.

The following table lists the part number and description for the 9336C-FX2 switch, fans, and power supplies:

== Requirements
Learn about the cnfiguration and network requiements for shared switches.

=== Configuration requirements
For configuration, you need the appropriate number and type of cables and cable connectors for your switches.

Depending on the type of switch you are initially configuring, you need to connect to the switch console port with the included console cable; you also need to provide specific network information.

=== Network requirements
You need the following network information for all switch configurations.

* IP subnet for management network traffic
* Host names and IP addresses for each of the storage system controllers and all applicable switches
* Most storage system controllers are managed through the e0M interface by connecting to the Ethernet service port (wrench icon). On AFF A800 and AFF A700s systems, the e0M interface uses a dedicated Ethernet port.

* Refer to the https://hwu.netapp.com[Hardware Universe] for the latest information.

For more information about the initial configuration of your switch, see the following guide: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/hw/nx-os/nexus9000/9336c-fx2-e/cisco-nexus-9336c-fx2-e-nx-os-mode-switch-hardware-installation-guide.html[Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 Installation and Upgrade Guide].

.Required documentation

You need specific switch and controller documentation to set up your ONTAP network.

To set up the Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 shared switches, see the https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/series.html[Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches Support] page.

== Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 cabling details

You can use the following cabling images to complete the cabling between the controllers and the switches.
If you want to cable NS224 storage as switch-attached, follow the switch-attached diagram:
// andris /ontap-systems-switches/pull/30

image:9336c_image1.jpg[Switch-attached]

If you want to cable NS224 storage as direct-attached instead of using the shared switch storage ports, follow the direct-attached diagram:
// andris /ontap-systems-switches/pull/30

image:9336c_image2.jpg[Direct-attached]

=== Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 cabling worksheet

If you want to document the supported platforms, you must complete the blank cabling worksheet by using completed sample cabling worksheet as a guide.

The sample port definition on each pair of switches is as follows:

Where:

* 100G ISL to switch A port 35
* 100G ISL to switch A port 36
* 100G ISL to switch B port 35
* 100G ISL to switch B port 36

=== Blank cabling worksheet

You can use the blank cabling worksheet to document the platforms that are supported as nodes in a cluster. The Supported Cluster Connections table of the Hardware Universe defines the cluster ports used by the platform.

Where:

* 100G ISL to switch A port 35
* 100G ISL to switch A port 36
* 100G ISL to switch B port 35
* 100G ISL to switch B port 36
