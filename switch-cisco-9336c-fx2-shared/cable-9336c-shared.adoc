== Cable NS224 storage as switch-attached
If you want to cable NS224 storage as switch-attached, follow the switch-attached diagram:
// andris /ontap-systems-switches/pull/30

See the https://hwu.netapp.com/Switch/Index[Hardware Universe] for more information on switch ports. See link:https://kb.netapp.com/Support/General_Support/What_additional_information_do_I_need_to_install_my_equipment_that_is_not_in_HWU[What additional information do I need to install my equipment that is not in HWU?^] for more information about switch installation requirements.

== Cable NS224 storage as direct-attached
If you want to cable NS224 storage as direct-attached instead of using the shared switch storage ports, follow the direct-attached diagram:
// andris /ontap-systems-switches/pull/30

See the https://hwu.netapp.com/Switch/Index[Hardware Universe] for more information on switch ports.

== Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 cabling worksheet

If you want to document the supported platforms, you must complete the blank cabling worksheet by using completed sample cabling worksheet as a guide.

The sample port definition on each pair of switches is as follows:

Where:

* 100G ISL to switch A port 35
* 100G ISL to switch A port 36
* 100G ISL to switch B port 35
* 100G ISL to switch B port 36

== Blank cabling worksheet

You can use the blank cabling worksheet to document the platforms that are supported as nodes in a cluster. The Supported Cluster Connections table of the Hardware Universe defines the cluster ports used by the platform.
