[.lead]
You can migrate from a switched configuration with direct-attached storage by adding two new shared switches.

.Supported switches
The following switches are supported:

* Nexus 9336C-FX2
* Nexus 3232C

The ONTAP and NX-OS versions supported in this procedure are on the Cisco Ethernet Switches page. See https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cisco-ethernet-switch[Cisco Ethernet switches].

.Connection Ports
The switches use the following ports to connect to nodes:

* Nexus 9336C-FX2:
** Ports 1- 3: Breakout mode (4x10G) Intra-Cluster Ports, int e1/1/1-4, e1/2/1-4, e1/3/1-4
** Ports 4- 6: Breakout mode (4x25G) Intra-Cluster/HA Ports, int e1/4/1-4, e1/5/1-4, e1/6/1-4
** Ports 7-34: 40/100GbE Intra-Cluster/HA Ports, int e1/7-34
* Nexus 3232C:
** Ports 1-30: 10/40/100 GbE
* The switches use the following Inter-Switch Link (ISL) ports:
** Ports int e1/35-36: Nexus 9336C-FX2
** Ports e1/31-32: Nexus 3232C

The https://hwu.netapp.com[Hardware Universe] contains information about supported cabling for all cluster switches.

.What you'll need

* Make sure you completed the following tasks:
** Configured some of the ports on Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches to run at 100 GbE.
** Planned, migrated, and documented 100 GbE connectivity from nodes to Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches.
** Migrated nondisruptively other Cisco cluster switches from an ONTAP cluster to Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 network switches.
* The existing switch network is properly set up and functioning.
* All ports are in the *up* state to ensure nondisruptive operations.
* The Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches are configured and operating under the proper version of NX-OS installed and reference configuration file (RCF) applied.
* The existing network configuration has the following:
** A redundant and fully functional NetApp cluster using both older Cisco switches.
** Management connectivity and console access to both the older Cisco switches and the new switches.
** All cluster LIFs in the *up* state with the cluster LIFs are on their home ports.
** ISL ports enabled and cabled between the other Cisco switches and between the new switches.

.About the examples

The examples in this procedure use the following switch and node nomenclature:

* The existing Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster switches are _c1_ and _c2_.
* The new Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches are _sh1_ and _sh2_.
* The nodes are _node1_ and _node2_.
* The cluster LIFs are _node1_clus1_ and _node1_clus2_ on node 1, and _node2_clus1_ and _node2_clus2_ on node 2 respectively.
* Switch c2 is replaced by switch sh2 first and then switch c1 is replaced by switch sh1.

.Steps

. If AutoSupport is enabled on this cluster, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=x h`
+
Where x is the duration of the maintenance window in hours.

. Check the administrative and operational status of each cluster port.
. Verify that all the cluster ports are up with a healthy status:
+
`network port show â€“role cluster`
+
