[.lead]
The NVIDIA SN2100 is a storage switch used to combine storage and cluster functionality into a shared switch configuration. Storage switches allow you to route data between servers and storage arrays in a Storage Area Network (SAN).

== Initial configuration overview

To configure a NVIDIA SN2100 switch on systems running ONTAP, follow these steps:

. link:install-hardware-sn2100-storage.html[Install the hardware for the NVIDIA SN2100 switch]. Instructions are available in the _NVIDIA Switch Installation Guide_.
. link:cabling-considerations-sn2100-storage.html[Review cabling and configuration considerations]. Review requirements for optical connections, the QSA adapter, and the switchport speed.
. link:install-cable-shelves-sn2100-storage.html[Cable NS224 shelves as switch-attached storage]. Follow these procedures if you have a system in which the NS224 drive shelves need to be cabled as switch-attached storage (not direct-attached storage).
. link:install-cumulus-mode-sn2100-storage.html[Install Cumulus Linux in Cumulus mode] or link:install-onie-mode-sn2100-storage.html[install Cumulus Linux in ONIE mode]. Cumulus Linux (CL) OS can be installed either when the switch is running Cumulus Linux or ONIE.
. link:install-rcf-sn2100-storage.html[Install the Reference Configuration File script]. There are two RCF scripts available for Clustering and Storage applications. 
. link:install-snmpv3-sn2100-storage.html[Configure SNMPv3 for switch log collection]. This release includes support for SNMPv3 for switch log collection and for Switch Health Monitoring (SHM).

NOTE: The procedures use Network Command Line Utility (NCLU), which is a command line interface that ensures Cumulus Linux is fully accessible to all. The net command is the wrapper utility you use to execute actions from a terminal.
