[.lead]
To install and configure the software for a NVIDIA SN2100 switch, follow these steps:

. link:install-cumulus-mode-sn2100-storage.html[Install Cumulus Linux in Cumulus mode] or link:install-onie-mode-sn2100-storage.html[install Cumulus Linux in ONIE mode]. 
+
You can install Cumulus Linux (CL) OS when the switch is running either Cumulus Linux or ONIE.

. link:install-rcf-sn2100-storage.html[Install the Reference Configuration File script]. 
+
There are two RCF scripts available for Clustering and Storage applications. 

//. link:install-snmpv3-sn2100-storage.html[Configure SNMPv3 for switch log collection]. 
//+
//This release includes support for SNMPv3 for switch log collection and for Switch Health Monitoring (SHM).

//The procedures use Network Command Line Utility (NCLU), which is a command line interface that ensures Cumulus Linux is fully accessible to all. The net command is the wrapper utility you use to execute actions from a terminal.
