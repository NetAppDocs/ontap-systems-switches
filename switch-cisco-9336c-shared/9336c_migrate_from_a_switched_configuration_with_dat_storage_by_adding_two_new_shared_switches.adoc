==== Migrate from a switched configuration with DAT storage

You must be aware of certain configuration information, port connections,  and cabling requirements when you are replacing some older Cisco Nexus cluster switches with Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 shared switches.

* The following switches are supported:
** Nexus 9336C-FX2
** Nexus 3232C
* The switches use the following ports for connections to nodes:
* Nexus 9336C-FX2:
** Ports 1- 3: Breakout mode (4x10G) Intra-Cluster Ports, int e1/1/1-4, e1/2/1-4, e1/3/1-4
** Ports 4- 6: Breakout mode (4x25G) Intra-Cluster/HA Ports, int e1/4/1-4, e1/5/1-4, e1/6/1-4
** Ports 7-34: 40/100GbE Intra-Cluster/HA Ports, int e1/7-34
* Nexus 3232C:
** Ports 1-30: 10/40/100 GbE
* The switches use the following Inter-Switch Link (ISL) ports:
** Ports int e1/35-36: Nexus 9336C-FX2
** Ports e1/31-32: Nexus 3232C
* The Hardware Universe contains information about supported cabling for all cluster switches.
+
See https://hwu.netapp.com[Hardware Universe] for more information.
* You have configured some of the ports on Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches to run at 100 GbE.
* You have planned, migrated, and documented 100 GbE connectivity from nodes to Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches.
* The ONTAP and NX-OS versions supported in this procedure are on the Cisco Ethernet Switches page. See https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cisco-ethernet-switch[Cisco Ethernet switches].
* You can migrate nondisruptively other Cisco cluster switches from an ONTAP cluster to Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 network switches.

===== Before you begin

* The existing switch network must be properly set up and functioning.
* All ports must be in the *up* state to ensure nondisruptive operations.
* The Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches must be configured and operating under the proper version of NX-OS installed and reference configuration file (RCF) applied.
* The existing network configuration must have the following:
** A redundant and fully functional NetApp cluster using both older Cisco switches.
** Management connectivity and console access to both the older Cisco switches and the new switches.
** All cluster LIFs in the *up* state with the cluster LIFs are on their home ports.
** ISL ports enabled and cabled between the other Cisco switches and between the new switches.

===== About this task

The examples in this procedure use the following switch and node nomenclature:

* The existing Cisco Nexus 3232C cluster switches are _c1_ and _c2_.
* The new Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches are _sh1_ and _sh2_.
* The nodes are _node1_ and _node2_.
* The cluster LIFs are _node1_clus1_ and _node1_clus2_ on node 1, and _node2_clus1_ and _node2_clus2_ on node 2 respectively.
* Switch c2 is replaced by switch sh2 first and then switch c1 is replaced by switch sh1.

===== Steps

. If AutoSupport is enabled on this cluster, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message:
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=x h`
+
Where x is the duration of the maintenance window in hours.

. Check the administrative and operational status of each cluster port.
. Verify that all the cluster ports are up with a healthy status:
`network port show â€“role cluster`
