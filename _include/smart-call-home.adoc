Smart Call Home monitors the hardware and software components on your network. When a critical system configuration occurs, it generates an email-based notification and raises an alert to all the recipients that are configured in your destination profile.

Before you use Smart Call Home, be aware of the following requirements:

* An email server must be in place.
* The switch must have IP connectivity to the email server.
* The contact name (SNMP server contact), phone number, and street address information must be configured. This is required to determine the origin of messages received.
* A CCO ID must be associated with an appropriate Cisco SMARTnet Service contract for your company.
* Cisco SMARTnet Service must be in place for the device to be registered.
