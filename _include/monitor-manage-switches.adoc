== Create a switch entry so that ONTAP can monitor it
Use the `system switch ethernet create` command to manually configure and enable monitoring for a specified Ethernet switch. This is helpful if ONTAP does not add the switch automatically, or if you previously removed the switch and want to re-add it.

[source,cli]
----
system switch ethernet create -device DeviceName -address 1.2.3.4 -snmp-version SNMPv2c -community-or-username cshm1! -model NX3132V -type cluster-network
----

A typical example is adding a switch named [DeviceName], with IP address 1.2.3.4, and SNMPv2c credentials set to *cshm1!*. Use `-type storage-network` instead of `-type cluster-network` if you are configuring a storage switch.

== Disable monitoring without deleting the switch
If you want to pause or stop monitoring for a certain switch, but still retain it for future monitoring, modify its `is-monitoring-enabled-admim` parameter instead of deleting it. 

For example:

[source,cli]
----
system switch ethernet modify -device DeviceName -is-monitoring-enabled-admin false
----

This lets you preserve switch details and configuration without generating new alerts or re-discoveries.

== Remove a switch you no longer need
Use `system switch ethernet delete` to delete a switch that has been disconnected or is no longer required:

[source,cli]
----
system switch ethernet delete -device DeviceName
----

By default, this command succeeds only if ONTAP does not currently detect the switch through CDP or LLDP. To remove a discovered switch, use the `-force` parameter:

[source,cli]
----
system switch ethernet delete -device DeviceName -force
----

When `-force` is used, the switch might be re-added automatically if ONTAP detects it again.
