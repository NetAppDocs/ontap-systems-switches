== Configuration requirements
[.lead]
To configure your cluster, you need the appropriate number and type of cables and cable connectors for your switches. Depending on the type of switch you are initially configuring, you need to connect to the switch console port with the included console cable; you also need to provide specific network information.

== Network requirements

You need the following network information for all switch configurations:

* IP subnet for management network traffic
* Host names and IP addresses for each of the storage system controllers and all applicable switches
* Most storage system controllers are managed through the e0M interface by connecting to the Ethernet service port (wrench icon). On AFF A800 and AFF A700 systems, the e0M interface uses a dedicated Ethernet port.

Refer to the https://hwu.netapp.com[Hardware Universe^] for latest information.

== Smart Call Home requirements
[.lead]
Smart Call Home monitors the hardware and software components on your network, to generate an email-based notification of critical system conditions. When an event occurs on your device, Smart Call Home raises an alert to all the recipients that are configured in your destination profile.

You must configure a cluster network switch to communicate using email with the Smart Call Home system. You can optionally set up your cluster network switch to take advantage of Cisco's embedded Smart Call Home support feature.

Before you can use Smart Call Home feature, you need to be aware of the following considerations:

* An email server must be in place.
* The switch must have IP connectivity to the email server.
* The contact name (SNMP server contact), phone number, and street address information must be configured. This is required to determine the origin of messages received.
* A CCO ID must be associated with an appropriate Cisco SMARTnet Service contract for your company.
* Cisco SMARTnet Service must be in place for the device to be registered.

The http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/index.html[Cisco support site^] contains information about the commands to configure Smart Call Home.

== Documentation requirements
You need specific switch and controller documentation to set up your Cisco Nexus 3232C switches and ONTAP cluster.

=== Switch documentation
To set up the Cisco Nexus 3232C switches, you need the following documentation from the https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-3000-series-switches/series.html[Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches Support^] page.
