Before configuring your Cisco 9336C-FX2 switch, review the following considerations. 

== Network requirements
* For cluster/storage/data switches using Nvidia's ConnectX-6 (CX6) and ConnectX-7 (CX7) cards for adapter port connectivity, it is necessary to hardcode the switch port speed to 40G or 100G. 
* On AFF A800 and AFF A700s systems, the e0M interface uses a dedicated Ethernet port.
* See the https://hwu.netapp.com/Switch/Index[Hardware Universe^] for more information on switch ports.

//== Port assignments
//You can use the Cisco 9336C-FX2 cluster switch port assignments table as a guide to configuring 
//your cluster.

//|===

//h| *Switch ports* h| *Ports usage* 
//a| 0-16
//a| 10/25GbE cluster port nodes, base configuration
//a| 17-48
//a| 10/25GbE cluster port nodes, with licenses
//a| 49-54	
//a| 40/100GbE cluster port nodes, with licenses, added right to left
//a| 55-56
//a| 100GbE cluster Inter-Switch Link (ISL) ports, base configuration 
	
//|===


== FEC requirements

* For 25G ports with copper cables, see the following table for details.
+
If the Controller side is `auto`, the switch side is set to FEC 25G.

* For 25G ports with Fiber/Optical cables, see the following table for details:

=== Bootarg implementation

Use the following command to set the 25G port FEC to either `auto` or `fc`, as required:
----
systemshell -node <node> -command sudo sysctl dev.ice.<X>.requested_fec=<auto/fc>
----

* When set to *`auto`*:
** The `auto` setting propagates the setting to hardware immediately and no reboot is required.
** If `bootarg.cpk_fec_fc_eXx already exists`, it is deleted from the bootarg storage.
** After a reboot, the `auto` setting remains in place since `auto` is the default FEC setting.

* When set to *`fc`*:
** The `FC-FEC` setting propagates the setting to the hardware immediately and no reboot is required.
** A new `bootarg.cpk_fec_fc_eXx` is created with the value set to "true".
** After a reboot, `FC-FEC` setting remains in place for the driver code to use.
