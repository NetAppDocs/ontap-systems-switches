[.lead]
Make sure you understand the configuration requirements, port connections and cabling requirements when you migrate to a two-node switched cluster with Cisco Nexus 3132Q-V cluster switches.

* The number of 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE ports are defined in the reference configuration files (RCFs) available on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/sanswitch/fcp/Cisco/netapp_cnmn/download.shtml[Cisco Â® Cluster Network Switch Reference Configuration File Download^] page.
* The cluster switches use the Inter-Switch Link (ISL) ports e1/31-32.
* The link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[Hardware Universe^] contains information about supported cabling to Nexus 3132Q-V switches:
 ** The nodes with 10 GbE cluster connections require QSFP optical modules with breakout fiber cables or QSFP to SFP+ copper break-out cables.
 ** The nodes with 40/100 GbE cluster connections require supported QSFP/QSFP28 optical modules with fiber cables or QSFP/QSFP28 copper direct-attach cables.
 ** The cluster switches use the appropriate ISL cabling: 2x QSFP28 fiber or copper direct-attach cables.
* On Nexus 3132Q-V, you can operate QSFP ports as either 40/100 Gb Ethernet or 4 x10 Gb Ethernet modes.
+
By default, there are 32 ports in the 40/100 Gb Ethernet mode. These 40 Gb Ethernet ports are numbered in a 2-tuple naming convention. For example, the second 40 Gb Ethernet port is numbered as 1/2. The process of changing the configuration from 40 Gb Ethernet to 10 Gb Ethernet is called _breakout_ and the process of changing the configuration from 10 Gb Ethernet to 40 Gb Ethernet is called _breakin_. When you break out a 40/100 Gb Ethernet port into 10 Gb Ethernet ports, the resulting ports are numbered using a 3-tuple naming convention. For example, the breakout ports of the second 40/100 Gb Ethernet port are numbered as 1/2/1, 1/2/2, 1/2/3, 1/2/4.

* On the left side of Nexus 3132Q-V is a set of four SFP+ ports multiplexed to the first QSFP port.
+
By default, the RCF is structured to use the first QSFP port.
+
You can make four SFP+ ports active instead of a QSFP port for Nexus 3132Q-V by using the `hardware profile front portmode sfp-plus` command. Similarly, you can reset Nexus 3132Q-V to use a QSFP port instead of four SFP+ ports by using the `hardware profile front portmode qsfp` command.

* You must have configured some of the ports on Nexus 3132Q-V to run at 10 GbE or 40/100 GbE.
+
You can break-out the first six ports into 4x10 GbE mode by using the `interface breakout module 1 port 1-6 map 10g-4x` command. Similarly, you can regroup the first six QSFP+ ports from breakout configuration by using the `no interface breakout module 1 port 1-6 map 10g-4x` command.

* You must have done the planning, migration, and read the required documentation on 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE connectivity from nodes to Nexus 3132Q-V cluster switches.
