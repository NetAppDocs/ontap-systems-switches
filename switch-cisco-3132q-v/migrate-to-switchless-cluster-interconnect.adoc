You can migrate from a cluster with a switched cluster network to one where two nodes are directly connected for ONTAP 9.3 and later.

[NOTE]
=========================================
It is recommended that you update your ONTAP version before proceeding with the switched to switchless operation for Cisco Nexus 3132Q-V switches.
