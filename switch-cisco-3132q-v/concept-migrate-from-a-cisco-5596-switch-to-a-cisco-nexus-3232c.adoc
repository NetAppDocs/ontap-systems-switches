You must be aware of certain configuration information, port connections and cabling requirements when you are replacing a Cisco Nexus 5596 cluster switch with a Cisco Nexus 3132Q-V cluster switch.

* The following cluster switches are supported:
 ** Nexus 5596
 ** Nexus 3132Q-V
* The number of 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE ports are defined in the reference configuration files (RCFs) available on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/sanswitch/fcp/Cisco/netapp_cnmn/download.shtml[CiscoÂ® Cluster Network Switch Reference Configuration File Download^] page.
* The cluster switches use the following ports for connections to nodes:
 ** Ports e1/1-40 (10 GbE): Nexus 5596
 ** Ports e1/1-30 (40/100 GbE): Nexus 3132Q-V
* The cluster switches use the following Inter-Switch Link (ISL) ports:
 ** Ports e1/41-48 (10 GbE): Nexus 5596
 ** Ports e1/31-32 (40/100 GbE): Nexus 3132Q-V
* The _Hardware Universe_ contains information about supported cabling to Nexus 3132Q-V switches:
 ** Nodes with 10 GbE cluster connections require QSFP to SFP+ optical fiber breakout cables or QSFP to SFP+ copper breakout cables.
 ** Nodes with 40/100 GbE cluster connections require supported QSFP/QSFP28optical modules with fiber cables or QSFP/QSFP28 copper direct-attach cables.
* The cluster switches use the appropriate ISL cabling:
 ** Beginning: Nexus 5596 to Nexus 5596 (SFP+ to SFP+)
  *** 8x SFP+ fiber or copper direct-attach cables
 ** Interim: Nexus 5596 to Nexus 3132Q-V (QSFP to 4xSFP+ break-out)
  *** 1x QSFP to SFP+ fiber break-out or copper break-out cables
 ** Final: Nexus 3132Q-V to Nexus 3132Q-V (QSFP28 to QSFP28)
  *** 2x QSFP28 fiber or copper direct-attach cables
* On Nexus 3132Q-V switches, you can operate QSFP/QSFP28 ports as either 40/100 Gigabit Ethernet or 4 x10 Gigabit Ethernet modes.
+
By default, there are 32 ports in the 40/100 Gigabit Ethernet mode. These 40 Gigabit Ethernet ports are numbered in a 2-tuple naming convention. For example, the second 40 Gigabit Ethernet port is numbered as 1/2. The process of changing the configuration from 40 Gigabit Ethernet to 10 Gigabit Ethernet is called _breakout_ and the process of changing the configuration from 10 Gigabit Ethernet to 40 Gigabit Ethernet is called _breakin_. When you break out a 40/100 Gigabit Ethernet port into 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports, the resulting ports are numbered using a 3-tuple naming convention. For example, the break-out ports of the second 40 Gigabit Ethernet port are numbered as 1/2/1, 1/2/2, 1/2/3, and 1/2/4.

* On the left side of Nexus 3132Q-V switches is a set of 4 SFP+ ports multiplexed to that QSFP28 port.
+
By default, the RCF is structured to use the QSFP28 port.
+
NOTE: You can make 4x SFP+ ports active instead of a QSFP port for Nexus 3132Q-V switches by using the `hardware profile front portmode sfp-plus` command. Similarly, you can reset Nexus 3132Q-V switches to use a QSFP port instead of 4x SFP+ ports by using the `hardware profile front portmode qsfp` command.

* You have configured some of the ports on Nexus 3132Q-V switches to run at 10 GbE or 40/100 GbE.
+
NOTE: You can break out the first six ports into 4x10 GbE mode by using the `interface breakout module 1 port 1-6 map 10g-4x` command. Similarly, you can regroup the first six QSFP+ ports from breakout configuration by using the `no interface breakout module 1 port 1-6 map 10g-4x` command.

* You have done the planning, migration, and read the required documentation on 10 GbE and 40/100 GbE connectivity from nodes to Nexus 3132Q-V cluster switches.
* The ONTAP and NX-OS versions supported in this procedure are on the _Cisco Ethernet Switches_ page.
