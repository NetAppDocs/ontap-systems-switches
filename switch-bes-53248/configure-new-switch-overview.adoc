Before configuring BES-53248 cluster switches for an initial installation, review the procedural overviews and the nomenclature used in the steps.

== Initial configuration overview

To initially configure a BES-53248 cluster switch on systems running ONTAP, follow these steps:

. link:configure-efos-software.html[Install the EFOS software]. Download and install the Ethernet Fabric OS (EFOS) software on the BES-53248 cluster switch.
. link:configure-licenses.html[Install licenses for BES-53248 cluster switches]. Optionally, add new ports by purchasing and installing more licenses. The switch base model is licensed for 16 10GbE or 25GbE ports and two 100GbE ports.
. link:configure-install-rcf.html[Install the Reference Configuration File (RCF)]. Install or upgrade the RCF on the BES-53248 cluster switch, and then verify the ports for an additional license after the RCF is applied.
. link:configure-health-monitor.html[Install the Cluster Switch Health Monitor (CSHM) configuration file]. Install the applicable configuration file for cluster switch health monitoring.
. link:configure-ssh.html[Enable SSH on BES-53248 cluster switches]. If you use the Cluster Switch Health Monitor (CSHM) and log collection features, enable SSH on the switches.
. link:configure-log-collection.html[Enable the log collection feature]. Use this feature to collect switch-related log files in ONTAP.

== Switch and node nomenclature

The examples in the configuration procedures use the following switch and node nomenclature:

* The NetApp switch names are `cs1` and `cs2`. The upgrade starts on the second switch, _cs2._
* The cluster LIF names are `node1_clus1` and `node1_clus2` for node1, and `node2_clus1` and `node2_clus2` for node2.
* The IPspace name is Cluster.
* The `cluster1::>` prompt indicates the name of the cluster.
* The cluster ports on each node are named `e0a` and `e0b`. See the https://hwu.netapp.com/Home/Index[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for the actual cluster ports supported on your platform.
* The Inter-Switch Links (ISLs) supported for the NetApp switches are ports 0/55 and 0/56.
* The node connections supported for the NetApp switches are ports 0/1 through 0/16 with default licensing.
* The examples use two nodes, but you can have up to 24 nodes in a cluster.
