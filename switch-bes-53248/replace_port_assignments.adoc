== Port group speed constraint

On BES-53248 cluster switches, the 48 10/25GbE (SFP28/SFP+) ports are combined into 12 x 4-port groups as follows:

* Ports 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16, 17-20, 21-24, 25-28, 29-32, 33-36, 37-40, 41-44, and 45-48.

The SFP28/SFP+ port speed must be the same (10GbE or 25GbE) across all ports in the 4-port group.
