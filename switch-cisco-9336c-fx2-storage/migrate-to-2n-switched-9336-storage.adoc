If you have an existing two-node _switchless_ cluster environment, you can migrate to a two-node _switched_ cluster environment using Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 switches to enable you to scale beyond two nodes in the cluster.

The migration process works for all nodes using optical or Twinax ports, but is not supported on this switch if nodes are using onboard 10Gb BASE-T RJ45 ports for the cluster-network ports.
