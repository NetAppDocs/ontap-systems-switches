Follow this procedure to configure the Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2 switch.

.What you'll need
* Access to an HTTP, FTP or TFTP server at the installation site to download the applicable NX-OS and reference configuration file (RCF) releases.
* Applicable NX-OS version, downloaded from the https://software.cisco.com/download/home[Cisco software download^] page. 
* Applicable licenses, network and configuration information, and cables.
* Completed link:setup-worksheet-9336c-storage.html[cabling worksheets].
* Applicable NetApp cluster network and management network RCFs downloaded from the NetApp Support Site at http://mysupport.netapp.com/[mysupport.netapp.com^]. All Cisco cluster network and management network switches arrive with the standard Cisco factory-default configuration. These switches also have the current version of the NX-OS software but do not have the RCFs loaded.
* Required switch documentation. See link:required-documentation-9336c-storage.html[Required documentation] for more information.
