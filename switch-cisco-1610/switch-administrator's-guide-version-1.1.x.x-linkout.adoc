summary: "If you have a two-node switchless cluster, you can migrate, non-disruptively, to a two-node switched cluster that includes NetApp CN1610 cluster-network switches. The procedure you use depends on whether you have two dedicated cluster-network ports on each controller or a single cluster port on each controller."
