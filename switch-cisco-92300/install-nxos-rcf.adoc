You can install the RCF after setting up the Nexus 92300YC switch for the first time.

.Switch and node nomenclature
The examples in this procedure use the following switch and node nomenclature:

* The names of the two Cisco switches are `cs1` and `cs2`.
* The node names are `node1` and `node2`.
* The cluster LIF names are `node1_clus1` and `node1_clus2` for node1 and `node2_clus1` and `node2_clus2` for node2.
* The `cluster1::*>` prompt indicates the name of the cluster.
* The cluster ports on each node are named `e0a` and `e0b`.
+
See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com/Home/Index[_Hardware Universe^_] for the actual cluster ports supported on your platform.

.Supported ports and node connections
* The Inter-Switch Links (ISLs) supported for the Nexus 92300YC switches are ports 1/65 and 1/66.
* The node connections supported for the Nexus 92300YC switches are ports 1/1 through 1/66.
* The examples in this procedure use two nodes. These nodes use two 10GbE cluster interconnect ports `e0a` and `e0b`. See the https://hwu.netapp.com/SWITCH/INDEX[Hardware Universe^] to verify the correct cluster ports on your platforms.

.Before you begin
* You must have the current RCF.
* The cluster must be fully functioning (there should be no errors in the logs or similar issues).
* You must have checked or set your desired boot configuration in the RCF to reflect the desired boot images if you are installing only NX-OS and keeping your current RCF version.
* If you need to change the boot configuration to reflect the current boot images, you must do so before reapplying the RCF so that the correct version is instantiated on future reboots.
* You must have consulted the switch compatibility table on the https://support.netapp.com/NOW/download/software/cm_switches/[Cisco Ethernet switch^] page for the supported ONTAP, NX-OS, and RCF versions.
* There can be command dependencies between the command syntax in the RCF and that found in versions of NX-OS.

.About this task
The procedure requires the use of both ONTAP commands and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches commands; ONTAP commands are used unless otherwise indicated.

The command outputs might vary depending on different releases of ONTAP.

.Steps
. Connect the cluster switch to the management network.
. Use the ping command to verify connectivity to the server hosting the RCF.
+
This example verifies that the switch can reach the server at IP address 172.19.2.1:

. Merge the RCF with the running-config of the switch:

cs2# *copy bootflash:Nexus_92300YC_RCF_v1.0.2.txt running-config*

Disabling ssh: as its enabled right now:

Enabling ssh: as it has been disabled
 this command enables edge port type (portfast) by default on all interfaces. You
 should now disable edge port type (portfast) explicitly on switched ports leading to hubs,
 switches and bridges as they may create temporary bridging loops.

Edge port type (portfast) should only be enabled on ports connected to a single
 host. Connecting hubs, concentrators, switches, bridges, etc...  to this
 interface when edge port type (portfast) is enabled, can cause temporary bridging loops.
 Use with CAUTION

Edge Port Type (Portfast) has been configured on Ethernet1/1 but will only
 have effect when the interface is in a non-trunking mode.
