If you want to build ONTAP clusters with more than two nodes, you need two supported cluster network switches. You can use additional management switches, which are optional.

You can install the Cisco Nexus 92300YC switch (X190003/R) in a NetApp system cabinet or third-party cabinet with the standard brackets that are included with the switch.

The following table lists the part number and description for the 92300YC switch, fans, and power supplies:
