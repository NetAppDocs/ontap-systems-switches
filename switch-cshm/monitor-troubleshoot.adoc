Alerts are raised if a fault, risk, or critical condition is detected in your cluster. 

If there are active alerts, the system health status reports a degraded status for the cluster.
The alerts raised include the information that you need to respond to degraded system health.

Active alerts can be displayed by running the command: `system health alert show -monitor ethernet-switch`
