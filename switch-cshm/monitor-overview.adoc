Health monitors proactively monitor certain critical conditions in your cluster and raise alerts if they detect a fault or risk.

If there are active alerts, the system health status reports a degraded status for the cluster.
The alerts include the information that you need to respond to degraded system health.

Active alerts can be displayed by running the command: system health alert show -monitor cluster-switch.
