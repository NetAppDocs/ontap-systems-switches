[.lead]
Health monitors proactively monitor certain critical conditions in your cluster and raise alerts if they detect a fault or risk.

If there are active alerts, the system health status reports a degraded status for the cluster.
The alerts include the information that you need to respond to degraded system health.

Alerts are enabled by running the command: `system health alert definition show -monitor ethernet-switch`
