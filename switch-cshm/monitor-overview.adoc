Health monitors proactively monitor certain critical conditions in your cluster and raise alerts if they detect a fault or risk.

//If there are active alerts, the system health status reports a degraded status for the cluster.
//The alerts include the information that you need to respond to degraded system health. 

To view the currently raised Ethernet switch health monitor alerts, run the command: `system health alert show -monitor ethernet-switch`

//Alerts are enabled by running the command: `system health alert definition show -monitor ethernet-switch`

To view the available Ethernet switch health monitor alerts, run the command: `system health alert definition show -monitor ethernet-switch`
