The Ethernet switch health monitor (CSHM) is responsible for ensuring the operational health of Cluster and Storage network switches and collecting switch logs for debugging purposes. This procedure guides you through the process of setting up and starting the collection of detailed *Support* logs from the switch and starts an hourly collection of *Periodic* data that is collected by AutoSupport.
