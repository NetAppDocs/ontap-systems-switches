SNMP is used to monitor the switches. Monitoring by SNMPv3 is configured by following this procedure. 

The Ethernet Switch Health Monitor (CSHM) utilizes SNMP to monitor the health and performance of cluster and storage switches. By default, SNMPv2c is configured automatically through the Reference Configuration File (RCF). SNMPv3 is more secure than SNMPv2 because it introduces robust security features such as authentication, encryption, and message integrity, which protect against unauthorized access and ensure data confidentiality and integrity during transmission.
