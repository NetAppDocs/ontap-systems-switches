[.lead]
From ONTAP 9.10.1P3, you can use NVIDIA MSN2100 switches to combine storage and cluster functionality into a shared switch scenario.

If you want to build ONTAP clusters with more than two nodes, you need two supported cluster network switches. You can use additional management switches, which are optional.

You install the NVIDIA MSN2100 switch (X190006/X190106) in the NVIDIA dual/single switch cabinet with the standard brackets that are included with the switch.
