The NVIDIA MSN2100 switch is a 10/25/40/100 GbE Ethernet switch running Cumulus Linux. The MSN2100 switch serves Cluster and Storage applications in ONTAP 9.10.1 over different switch-pairs.
Cumulus Linux (CL) OS can be installed either when the switch is running Cumulus Linux or ONIE.
For this release, the minimal version of Cumulus Linux supported is 4.4.2.
NOTE: The procedures here use Network Command Line Utility (NCLU) which is a command line interface that ensures Cumulus Linux is fully accessible to all. The net command is the wrapper utility you use to execute actions from a terminal.
