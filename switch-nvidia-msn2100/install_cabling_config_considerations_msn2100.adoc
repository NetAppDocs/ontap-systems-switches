Before configuring your NVIDIA MSN2100 switch, review the following information:

. Only optical connections are supported on MSN2100 switches with X1151A NIC, X1146A NIC, or onboard 100GbE ports on AFF A800. (Burts 1397967 and 1402399)
. When a QSA adapter is used to connect to the onboard Intel cluster ports on the FAS2750 platform, not all links come up. To resolve this issue, do the following:
.. For Intel 10G, manually set the swp1s0-3 link speed to 10000 and set auto-negotiation to offset
.. For Chelsio 25G, manually set the swp2s0-3 link speed to 25000 and set auto-negotiation to off


NOTE: Using 10G/25G QSA, use the non-breakout 40/100G ports. Do not insert the QSA adapter on ports that are configured for breakout. This results in only one port being available for use. (Burts 1433115, 1407009)
