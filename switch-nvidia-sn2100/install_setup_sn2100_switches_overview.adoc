The NVIDIA SN2100 switch is a 10/25/40/100 Gb Ethernet switch running Cumulus Linux. The SN2100 switch serves Cluster and Storage applications in ONTAP 9.10.1P3 over different switch-pairs.

Cumulus Linux (CL) OS can be installed either when the switch is running Cumulus Linux or ONIE.
For this release, the minimal version of Cumulus Linux supported is 4.4.2.


NOTE: The procedures here use Network Command Line Utility (NCLU) which is a command line interface that ensures Cumulus Linux is fully accessible to all. The net command is the wrapper utility you use to execute actions from a terminal.

IMPORTANT: When using breakout cables for 10G and 25G, make sure that auto-negotiation is off and hard set the port speed on the switch. See link:install_cabling_config_considerations_sn2100.html[Cabling and configuration considerations^] for further details.
